# spit-site

A toy project of mine to learn [Clojure](http://clojure.org).

The idea is that this will be some sort of tool similar to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) in that it takes dynamic data and generates a static site.

However the core concept of spit-site is the equation: `templates` + `data` = `web-site`.

Given the following directory structure:

```
root
 |__ templates
      |____ products
              |______index.mustache
      |____ about.mustache
 |__ data
      |_____products/index.json
```

Containing the files:

`templates/products/index.mustache`

```mustache
<h1>Product catalog {{year}}</h1>

<ul>
{{#products}}
  <li>{{name}} {{#price}} available at: ${{.}}{{/price}}</li>
{{#products}}
</ul>
```

`templates/about.mustache`

```mustache
<h1>About MyCompany</h1>

<p>Dedicated to you!</p>
```

`data/products.json`

```json
{
  "year": 2013,
  "products": [
    {
      "name": "Screwdriver",
      "price": 19.90
    },
    {
      "name": "Hammer"
    }
  ]
}
```

A site with two pages would be created: 

`example.com/about.html`:

```html
<h1>About MyCompany</h1>

<p>Dedicated to you!</p>
```

and `example.com/products/index.html`:

```html
<h1>Product catalog 2013</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Screwdriver available at: $19.90</li>
  <li>Hammer</li>
</ul>
```

## Usage

Probably something like: 

```
spit-site --templates ./my-templates --data ./my-data
```

(default values for the directories are: `./templates` and `./data`)
