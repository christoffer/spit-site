# spit-site

A toy project of mine to learn [Clojure](http://clojure.org).

The idea is that this will be some sort of tool similar to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). However the core concept of spit-site is the equation: `templates` + `data` = `web-site`.

## Usage

Having something like `spit-site --templates ./templates --data ./data`, but this far from implemented or decided.
